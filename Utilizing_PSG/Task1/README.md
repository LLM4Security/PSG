# Task1: App Description Generation



## Dataset

The original DescribeCtx dataset has already been open-sourced; therefore, we are only releasing the newly constructed dataset here.

 A detailed description of each table is provided below.

- `apk_list`: This list was generated following the approach outlined in the DescribeCtx paper, through which we collected a new dataset.
- `data.csv`: Here is the table containing a comparison of descriptions generated for the same APK using PSG-based and DescribeCtx-based methods, along with their corresponding BLEU-n scores and ROUGE-L metrics.
- `results_ctx.csv`: Here is the table containing descriptions generated based on DescribeCtx along with their corresponding BLEU-n scores (ranging from 1 to 4) and ROUGE-L metrics.
- `results_psg.csv`ï¼šHere is the table containing descriptions generated based on PSG along with their corresponding BLEU-n scores (ranging from 1 to 4) and ROUGE-L metrics.
