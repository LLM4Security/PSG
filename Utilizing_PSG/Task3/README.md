## 2FA App Dataset

We created a 2FA app dataset, as no large-scale dataset of this kind currently exists.

- **2FA**: This file contains the mobile apps corresponding to the domains of websites that have adopted 2FA, which we obtained from the open-source project 2FA Directory. We searched for these apps in mainstream markets, including Google Play and Xiaomi Market.
- **top500**: This file contains apps identified as 2FA apps from the top 500 most downloaded apps in Google Play and Xiaomi Market, found by searching for 2FA-related keywords.
