# Evaluation of PSG Construction

This section presents our evaluation of PSG (Page Summary Graph) construction efficiency using a selection of apps from both state-of-the-art benchmarks and real-world applications.



## App Selection

- **Benchmark Apps**: We selected all 20 apps from AndroidBench, a widely used benchmark in app analysis tasks that includes apps with diverse functionalities and ICC (Inter-Component Communication) types.
- **Real-World Apps**: Additionally, we randomly selected 20 popular real-world apps from the Google Play store for evaluation.



## App Information & Open-Source Content

Detailed information about the apps used in this evaluation, including their sources, APK sizes, and download counts, is provided in the paper.

 The open-source data we have shared consists of the human correctness ratings for all Page Summaries successfully generated by these apps, including their precision and consistency scores.
